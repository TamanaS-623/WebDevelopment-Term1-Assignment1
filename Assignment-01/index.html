			<p > Canada, French: [ka.na.d…ë]) is a country in North America, located to the north of the United States. Its land reaches from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Pacific Ocean in the west and the Arctic Ocean to the north, covering 9.98 million square kilometres (3.85 million square miles), making it the world's second largest country by total area and the fourth largest country by land area. It has the world's longest coastline which touches three oceans.</p>
			<p> The places that are now Canada have long been home to many Aboriginal people. In 1537 the French started a colony and the British empire soon followed. The two empires fought several wars and in the late 18th century only British North America remained with what is more or less Canada today</p>	
			<p>Canada is a federal parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom as its head of state. The country is officially bilingual at the federal level, meaning that citizens have the right to communicate with the government in either English or French.</p>
